Vector2.js is a lightweight 2D vector library from ThreeJS's source code.
parser.js is an svg parser I found online.

The rest of the files should be my code. Here are some of the key ones:
```
    <script src="parser.js"></script>
    <script src="logger.js"></script> <!-- dumb in browser logging -->
    <script src="Vector2.js"></script> <!-- geometry library -->
    <script src="helpers.js"></script> <!-- helpers for geometry -->
    <script src="Player.js"></script> <!-- player rendering and interaction with rail updates -->
    <script src="Level.js"></script> <!-- full level management, dealing with main scene rendering -->
    <script src="materials.js"></script> <!-- basic set of materials for walls -->
    <script src="levels.js"></script> <!-- geometry for actual playable levels -->
    <script src="inputs.js"></script> <!-- captures inputs -->
    
    <script src="parkour.js"></script> <!-- runs everything -->
```

Some of the links in parkour.html (main HTML file) are broken as this was intended for the main version on the website which you can see [here](https://ojas.smartlylinked.co.uk/en/flight/).
